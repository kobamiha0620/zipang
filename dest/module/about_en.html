                        "RENT", and other musicals, and is known for his overwhelming singing ability; and vocalist
                        "Kokoronosuke", whose charming and memorable voice sets him apart in the world of traditional

                        <br><br>
                        The name "ZIPANG OPERA" was chosen to reflect their performances, which are like operas for each
                        song. They express a unique Japanese worldview through various musical approaches, such as EDM,
                        electro-pop, mixtures, rap, and pop.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the highlights of their performances is how the worldview changes with each song,
                        utilizing the strengths of each member. The artist-producer is the director and active performer
                        "PaniCrew", "Tsuyoshi Ueki".
                        They aim to share this new style of Japanese pop music with the world.
